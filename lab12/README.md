# LC-3 Basic IO
## Overview
In this lab, you will learn about the IO system in the LC-3 ISA by writing a program that accepts input, process it, and prints it to the screen.

Specifically, you will read in some ASCII characters, and use these characters to print a pixel map of a character according to [VGA text mode standard](https://wiki.osdev.org/VGA_Fonts#Decoding_of_bitmap_fonts).

## Specification
- The program must start at `x3000`
- The program will accept three ASCII characters, in the following order: (We guarantee all characters will be valid)
    1. The character to print for bit 0
    2. The character to print for bit 1
    3. The character whose pixel map to print
- The program must use `GETC` to get the characters instead of `IN`
    - The inclusion of the string `"IN"` anywhere within `lab12.asm` will result in an immediate 0
- The program will need to access the font data, provided in [font_data.asm](font_data.asm)
    - Do not edit this file
    - For grading, we will replace this file with an exact same copy
- The program will utilize the font data for the character to print to the screen

## How does font_data work?
- There are 2^8 = 256 ASCII characters (including extended ones)
    - The table starts with the `x0` ASCII or NULL
- Each character has a bitfield pixel map of 8x16 (width x height)
- Each row occupies occupies one memory location
- For each row, the 8 column bits occupies the top 8 bits of that row

For example, this is the bitfield pixel map for `'A'`: (squint your eyes)

## Recommendations

### Use flowchart 
It is highly recommended to at least draw a flowchart or write down the logical steps so you know exactly what to do before you start writing code.

### Sneak-peak for lab 13
In lab 13, you will extend up this lab to print a string instead of just a single character. Therefore, it is in your best interest to make the program modular and less dependent on the number of registers available to you.
